# Privacy Interpreter Design Document

## 1. Purpose & Rationale

The Privacy Interpreter is a core component of the Privacy Protocol. Its primary purpose is to **transform human-readable privacy policies (e.g., website terms, legal documents) into a machine-readable, structured format** that the system can use for automated consent management and data governance. This is crucial for:
* **Automating Consent:** Enabling AI (like DashAIBrowser's AI-Assisted Consent) to understand and suggest optimal privacy settings.
* **Ensuring Compliance:** Translating complex legal text into verifiable rules.
* **User Empowerment:** Providing transparent, digestible summaries of policies.
* **Strategic Alignment:** Directly supporting "Granular Privacy Controls & AI-Assisted Consent" in DashAIBrowser.

## 2. Core Functionality ("What")

The Privacy Interpreter will perform the following key functions:

* **Policy Ingestion:** Accept privacy policies in various formats (e.g., raw text, HTML from web pages, PDF - conceptual).
* **Text Preprocessing:** Clean and normalize the ingested text (e.g., remove boilerplate, identify sections).
* **Semantic Analysis:** Identify and extract key privacy-related entities and relationships using Natural Language Processing (NLP). This includes:
    * **Data Categories:** What types of data are collected (e.g., PII, usage data, location, biometric).
    * **Purposes of Collection:** Why data is collected (e.g., service delivery, analytics, marketing, security).
    * **Third Parties:** Who data is shared with.
    * **Retention Periods:** How long data is kept.
    * **User Rights:** Opt-out mechanisms, data access requests.
    * **Legal Basis:** GDPR-relevant legal justifications (e.g., consent, contract).
* **Structured Output Generation:** Convert the extracted information into a standardized, machine-readable format (e.g., a `PrivacyPolicy` object as defined in `src/privacy_framework/policy.py`).
* **Policy Summarization:** Generate concise, human-readable summaries of complex policies.
* **Version Control (Conceptual):** Track different versions of the same policy.

## 3. High-Level Implementation Strategy ("How")

The Privacy Interpreter will be implemented in Python, leveraging its robust NLP ecosystem.

* **NLP Libraries:** Utilize libraries like `spaCy` or `NLTK` for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and dependency parsing.
* **Rule-Based Extraction:** Initial implementation will rely on a combination of rule-based patterns (e.g., regex, keyword matching) and heuristic logic to identify privacy clauses.
* **Machine Learning (Future Enhancement):** For more sophisticated semantic understanding and generalization, future iterations will explore supervised or unsupervised ML models (e.g., text classification, sequence labeling) trained on privacy policy datasets. This could leverage **EchoSphere AI-vCPU's Language_Modeler** core for advanced inference.
* **Integration with Data Structures:** Output will directly populate instances of the `PrivacyPolicy` class.
* **Scalability:** Designed to process policies efficiently, potentially in parallel for large volumes.

## 4. Synergies & Interconnections

* **`PrivacyPolicy` Data Structure:** Directly consumes and populates instances of this class.
* **`PolicyEvaluator`:** Provides the structured `PrivacyPolicy` objects that the Evaluator uses to make access decisions.
* **DashAIBrowser ASOL:** The Interpreter could be a service within DashAIBrowser's ASOL, analyzing policies of visited websites.
* **EchoSphere AI-vCPU:** The `Language_Modeler` core would be the primary compute resource for complex NLP tasks.
* **User Experience:** Enables the "AI-Analyzed Privacy Policies" feature in DashAIBrowser.

## 5. Anticipated Challenges & Conceptual Solutions

* **Ambiguity in Legal Text:** Legal language is often intentionally vague or open to interpretation.
    * **Solution:** Develop confidence scores for extracted information. Flag ambiguous clauses for human review. Iterative refinement of NLP models.
* **Format Variability:** Policies come in many unstructured formats (web pages, PDFs).
    * **Solution:** Focus on HTML/plain text initially. Integrate OCR for PDFs in future. Develop robust web scraping techniques.
* **Scalability of NLP:** Processing large volumes of text can be computationally intensive.
    * **Solution:** Optimize NLP pipelines. Leverage parallel processing capabilities of `EchoSphere AI-vCPU`.
* **Maintaining Up-to-Date Rules/Models:** Policies change frequently.
    * **Solution:** Implement automated retraining pipelines for ML models. Develop mechanisms for rapid rule updates.
