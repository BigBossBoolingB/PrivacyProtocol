# Design Document: Privacy Interpreter

**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** $(date +"%Y-%m-%d") <!-- Will be filled by script or manually -->
**Status:** Conceptual

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the conceptual design for the **Privacy Interpreter** component of the Privacy Protocol project. The primary goal of this component is to analyze privacy policy texts and transform complex legal jargon into understandable insights for the end-user.

It will focus on two main capabilities as per the README:
*   **Disagreement & Questionable Clause Identification:** Intelligently flagging terms open to alternate interpretations or known to be disagreeable.
*   **Plain-Language Translation:** Providing clear, jargon-free explanations of complex legal clauses, leveraging **AI Humanization** principles.

## 2. Goals

*   To accurately identify clauses within a privacy policy that are potentially harmful, ambiguous, or commonly disagreed with by privacy advocates.
*   To translate identified clauses (and ideally, the entire policy summary) into simple, clear language that a non-expert can understand.
*   To provide a confidence score or level of concern for identified clauses.
*   To be extensible for future enhancements, such as deeper semantic understanding or multilingual support.

## 3. Core Functionality

### 3.1. Input

*   Raw text of a privacy policy.
*   (Optional) URL of the policy for metadata logging and context.
*   (Optional) User profile information to tailor sensitivity or highlight specific concerns.

### 3.2. Processing Steps (Conceptual)

1.  **Preprocessing:**
    *   Text cleaning (e.g., removing excessive whitespace, normalizing unicode).
    *   Sentence segmentation and potentially paragraph/section identification.
2.  **Clause Identification:**
    *   **Keyword/Pattern Matching:** Utilize a predefined library of keywords, phrases, and regular expressions associated with common privacy concerns (e.g., "sell data," "third-party sharing," "data retention period," "right to be forgotten").
    *   **NLP-based Classification (Future):** Employ machine learning models (e.g., text classifiers trained on labeled privacy policy clauses) to identify types of clauses (e.g., data collection, data usage, data sharing, user rights, security).
    *   **Disagreement/Questionable Heuristics:** Apply rules or models to flag clauses based on:
        *   Presence of overly broad language ("including but not limited to").
        *   Lack of specificity (e.g., undefined retention periods).
        *   Contradictory statements.
        *   Known anti-patterns in privacy policies.
3.  **Plain-Language Translation:**
    *   **Template-based Summaries:** For common clause types, use predefined templates to generate summaries.
    *   **AI-Powered Paraphrasing (Future):** Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) or other NLP techniques to rephrase complex sentences into simpler terms. This must be carefully controlled to maintain accuracy.
    *   **AI Humanization:** Ensure translated text is not only simple but also empathetic and empowering, avoiding overly technical or alarming language where possible, while still conveying risk.
4.  **Risk/Concern Scoring (Integration with RiskScorer):**
    *   Identified clauses will contribute to the overall risk score calculated by the `RiskScorer` module.
    *   The interpreter might assign an internal severity level to flagged clauses.

### 3.3. Output

*   A list of identified clauses of interest, each with:
    *   Original text.
    *   Plain-language explanation/summary.
    *   Type of concern (e.g., "data selling," "vague language," "broad rights waiver").
    *   Severity/confidence score.
*   A general summary of the policy in plain language (Future).

## 4. Key Technologies & Techniques (Considerations)

*   **Python:** Core development language.
*   **NLP Libraries:**
    *   `spaCy` or `NLTK` for text processing, tokenization, POS tagging, named entity recognition.
    *   `scikit-learn` for traditional ML models if used for classification.
    *   Potentially `transformers` library for access to pre-trained LLMs (e.g., for summarization, paraphrasing), keeping in mind computational resources and privacy of processed data.
*   **Rule Engine (Optional):** For managing complex sets of identification rules.
*   **Databases/Knowledge Bases:** To store patterns, known problematic clauses, and translations.

## 5. Data Sources for Training/Knowledge Base (Conceptual)

*   Publicly available privacy policies.
*   Annotated datasets of privacy policy clauses (e.g., UsablePrivacy Project, CLAUDETTE).
*   Summaries and analyses from privacy advocacy groups (e.g., EFF, ToS;DR).

## 6. AI Humanization Principles

*   **Clarity:** Use simple words and short sentences.
*   **Actionability:** Frame explanations in a way that helps users understand implications for them.
*   **Context:** Explain *why* a clause is important or concerning.
*   **Tone:** Be informative and helpful, not alarmist or overly technical.

## 7. Challenges & Considerations

*   **Ambiguity of Legal Language:** Legal texts are often intentionally complex.
*   **Evolving Policies:** Policies change, requiring the system to adapt.
*   **Maintaining Accuracy:** Translations and summaries must not misrepresent the original meaning.
*   **Scalability:** Processing large volumes of text efficiently.
*   **Ethical Implications:** Ensuring the AI's interpretations are fair and unbiased. The "AI What If Scenarios" feature will need careful ethical review.
*   **Over-simplification vs. Legal Nuance:** Finding the right balance.

## 8. Future Enhancements

*   Deeper semantic analysis of clauses.
*   Cross-referencing clauses within a policy.
*   Comparative analysis against previous versions of the same policy (integration with `PolicyTracker`).
*   User-specific highlighting based on `UserProfile` preferences.
*   Support for multiple languages.

## 9. Integration with Other Modules

*   **`ClauseIdentifier`:** This module will likely be a sub-component or tightly integrated part of the `Interpreter`.
*   **`RiskScorer`:** Provides data to and receives input from the `RiskScorer`.
*   **`MainApp`:** The `Interpreter` will be a core service called by the main application logic.

This document provides a high-level overview. Detailed specifications for algorithms, data structures, and APIs will be developed as implementation progresses.
