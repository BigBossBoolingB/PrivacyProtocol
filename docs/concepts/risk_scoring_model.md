# Design Document: Privacy Risk Scoring Model

**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** $(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
**Status:** Conceptual

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the conceptual design for the **Privacy Risk Scoring Model** within the Privacy Protocol project. The goal of this model is to generate a quantifiable "Privacy Risk Score" for any given privacy agreement, providing users with an at-a-glance understanding of potential risks.

## 2. Goals

*   To provide a clear, concise, and quantifiable measure of the potential privacy risks associated with a policy.
*   To make the risk score adaptable based on individual user privacy preferences (from `UserProfile`).
*   To ensure the scoring mechanism is transparent and understandable, at least at a high level.
*   To create a system that can be iteratively improved as more sophisticated analysis techniques are developed.

## 3. Core Functionality

### 3.1. Input

*   The full text of the privacy policy.
*   Identified clauses of concern from the `PrivacyInterpreter` (including their type and potential severity).
*   (Optional) User's `UserProfile`, specifically their privacy tolerance levels.
*   (Optional) Configuration data from `config.py` (e.g., `RISK_WEIGHTS`).

### 3.2. Scoring Algorithm (Conceptual Stages)

1.  **Baseline Policy Analysis (Policy-Level Factors):**
    *   **Presence of Key Risky Clauses:** The `PrivacyInterpreter` will identify clauses related to:
        *   Data selling
        *   Broad third-party data sharing (especially for marketing)
        *   Vague data retention policies (or overly long ones)
        *   Tracking for purposes beyond core functionality
        *   Lack of clear opt-out mechanisms for significant data uses
        *   Waivers of user rights
        *   Weak language around security measures
        *   Collection of highly sensitive data (e.g., biometrics, precise location) without strong justification.
    *   **Policy Readability/Length (Future):** Potentially factor in the complexity or excessive length of a policy as a negative indicator (though this is subjective).
    *   **Absence of Protective Clauses (Future):** Penalize for not mentioning user rights like access, rectification, deletion where expected by regulation (e.g., GDPR).

2.  **Factor Weighting:**
    *   Assign weights to different types of risky clauses or policy characteristics. These weights can be predefined (e.g., in `config.py`) and potentially adjusted by expert input or machine learning over time.
    *   Example initial weights (from `config.py`):
        *   `"data_selling": 0.4`
        *   `"third_party_sharing_broad": 0.3`
        *   `"weak_security_clause": 0.2`
        *   `"ambiguous_language": 0.1`

3.  **User Profile Personalization:**
    *   Adjust the impact of certain factors based on the user's `UserProfile` tolerance settings.
    *   **Example:** If a policy mentions "data selling" (base risk contribution), and the user's profile indicates "Very High" sensitivity to data selling, the contribution of this factor to their *personal* risk score is amplified. Conversely, if their sensitivity is "Low," its impact might be slightly dampened (though data selling is generally always a risk).
    *   The placeholder logic in `RiskScorer.calculate_risk_score` currently adds a flat value if "data selling" is present and user tolerance for "data_sharing" is "low". This will be refined.

4.  **Score Calculation & Normalization:**
    *   Aggregate the weighted risk factors.
    *   Normalize the score to a standard range (e.g., 0-100 or 0-10), where a higher score indicates higher risk.
    *   The current `RiskScorer` placeholder uses a simple additive approach and caps the score. This will become more nuanced.

### 3.3. Output

*   A numerical **Privacy Risk Score**.
*   (Optional) A qualitative rating (e.g., "Low Risk," "Moderate Risk," "High Risk," "Very High Risk").
*   (Optional) A list of the top contributing factors to the score for that specific policy and user.

## 4. `RiskScorer` Module (`privacy_protocol_core/risk_assessment/scorer.py`)

*   The `RiskScorer` class will encapsulate the scoring logic.
*   The `calculate_risk_score(policy_text, user_profile=None)` method is the primary interface.
*   The `generate_risk_dashboard(user_id)` method will eventually use these scores to provide an overview (currently a placeholder).

## 5. Risk Dashboard (`generate_risk_dashboard`)

*   This feature will provide users with an overview of their digital privacy posture.
*   It will likely display:
    *   An average risk score across all policies analyzed for the user.
    *   A list of recently analyzed policies and their risk scores.
    *   Highlights of common risks found.
    *   Trends over time (Future).

## 6. Transparency and Explainability

*   While the exact algorithm might be complex, the system should be able to explain *why* a policy received a certain score by highlighting the main contributing clauses or factors.
*   This helps users understand the score and not just see it as a black box number.

## 7. Challenges and Considerations

*   **Subjectivity of Risk:** What one person considers high risk, another might not. Personalization helps, but a baseline objective measure is also needed.
*   **Complexity of Policies:** Accurately identifying and weighting all relevant factors in diverse and lengthy legal documents.
*   **Balancing Factors:** Determining appropriate weights for different risk factors. This may require expert consultation or learning from data.
*   **Avoiding "Gaming" the Score:** Ensuring the model is robust against policies written to achieve a good score without genuinely improving privacy.
*   **Keeping Up-to-Date:** Privacy risks and policy language evolve, so the model and its knowledge base (e.g., risky keywords, clause patterns) must be updated.

## 8. Future Enhancements

*   **Machine Learning-based Scoring:** Train ML models on datasets of policies annotated with risk levels to automatically learn weights or identify complex risk patterns.
*   **Comparative Scoring:** Show how a policy's score compares to others in the same industry or category.
*   **Contextual Risk:** Consider the type of service the policy is for (e.g., a social media app might have inherently different data needs and risks than a utility app).
*   **Regulatory Compliance Checks:** Incorporate checks for compliance with specific regulations (GDPR, CCPA) and factor non-compliance into the risk score.

This conceptual design will be the basis for the initial implementation and will be refined through iterative development and testing.
