# Design Document: Personalized Privacy Profiles

**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** $(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
**Status:** Conceptual

## 1. Introduction

This document details the conceptual design for **Personalized Privacy Profiles** within the Privacy Protocol system. This feature allows users to define their individual privacy tolerance levels and preferences, enabling the system to tailor its analysis, alerts, and recommendations accordingly.

## 2. Goals

*   To empower users to express their personal comfort levels regarding various data practices.
*   To enable Privacy Protocol to provide more relevant and personalized feedback on privacy policies.
*   To customize risk scoring and alerts based on individual user sensitivities.
*   To provide a mechanism for users to save preferences and track their interactions with the system.

## 3. Core Functionality

### 3.1. Profile Attributes

A user profile will store information such as:

*   **User Identifier:** A unique ID for the user (e.g., generated UUID, or linked to an authentication system in the future).
*   **Privacy Tolerance Levels:** User-defined settings for various categories of data practices. Examples:
    *   `data_sharing_with_third_parties`: (e.g., "Strict", "Moderate", "Lenient") or (1-5 scale)
    *   `data_retention_period`: (e.g., "Short", "Medium", "Long")
    *   `use_of_cookies_for_tracking`: (e.g., "Allow Essential Only", "Allow Functional", "Allow All")
    *   `personalized_advertising`: (e.g., "Opt-Out Preferred", "Neutral", "Accept")
    *   `data_selling_sensitivity`: (e.g., "Very High", "High", "Moderate")
    *   `location_tracking`: (e.g., "Disabled", "While Using App", "Always On")
*   **Custom Alerts/Keywords:** A list of specific terms or phrases the user wants to be alerted about if found in a policy (e.g., "biometric data," "children's data," "social media plugins").
*   **Risk Score Calibration (Future):** User adjustments to how different risk factors are weighted in their personal risk score.
*   **History of Analyzed Policies (Integration with `MetadataLogger`):** Links or references to policies the user has previously analyzed.
*   **Saved Preferences:** General application settings (e.g., notification preferences).

### 3.2. Profile Creation and Management

*   **Initial Setup:** Users can be guided through a setup wizard to define their initial preferences for key tolerance levels. Default settings will be provided.
*   **Editing Profiles:** Users can modify their profile settings at any time through a dedicated interface.
*   **Storage:**
    *   **Initial Phase:** In-memory storage (`profiles` dictionary in `PrivacyProtocolApp`) for simplicity during early development.
    *   **Future:** Persistent storage (e.g., local file, browser storage for client-side, or a database for server-side applications with user accounts).

### 3.3. Integration with Other Modules

*   **`RiskScorer`:** The `RiskScorer` will use the user's tolerance levels to adjust the calculation of privacy risk scores. For example, a clause about data sharing might contribute more to the risk score for a user with "Strict" tolerance for data sharing.
*   **`Interpreter`:** The `Interpreter` can use custom alert keywords from the profile to highlight specific sections of a policy. It might also tailor the "humanization" of language based on user sophistication (future).
*   **`Recommender`:** Recommendations will be more personalized. If a user has a strict stance on tracking, the `Recommender` might more aggressively suggest alternatives or opt-out measures.
*   **`MetadataLogger`:** User actions related to their profile (e.g., updating preferences) can be logged.

## 4. User Interface (UI) Considerations (Conceptual)

*   **Intuitive Controls:** Use clear labels, sliders, dropdowns, or toggles for setting tolerance levels.
*   **Guidance and Explanation:** Provide brief explanations for each preference setting, so users understand the implications.
*   **Privacy Dashboard:** The user profile section could be part of a larger "Privacy Dashboard" that also displays overall risk posture and recent activity.

## 5. Technical Design (Initial - `profiles.py`)

*   The `UserProfile` class in `privacy_protocol_core/user_management/profiles.py` will serve as the basic data structure.
*   Methods like `set_tolerance()` and `add_custom_alert()` are already defined.
*   The `PrivacyProtocolApp` class in `main.py` manages a dictionary of `UserProfile` objects.

## 6. Challenges and Considerations

*   **Defining Tolerance Categories:** Selecting a comprehensive yet manageable set of privacy categories for users to configure.
*   **User Experience:** Making the profile setup and management process easy and not overwhelming.
*   **Default Settings:** Choosing sensible defaults that offer a good baseline of protection/awareness.
*   **Data Privacy of Profiles:** If profiles are stored server-side, ensuring the privacy and security of this sensitive user preference data is paramount.
*   **Granularity vs. Simplicity:** Finding the right balance in how detailed the preferences can be.

## 7. Future Enhancements

*   **Predefined Personas:** Offer pre-set profile configurations (e.g., "Privacy Novice," "Tech Savvy," "Maximum Protection").
*   **Import/Export Profiles:** Allow users to save and share their profile settings.
*   **Learning Profiles (Advanced):** The system could learn user preferences over time based on their reactions to analyzed policies (with explicit user consent).
*   **Integration with Authentication:** If user accounts are implemented, link profiles to accounts for persistence across sessions/devices.

This design focuses on the initial, conceptual implementation. Further details will be refined as development progresses.
