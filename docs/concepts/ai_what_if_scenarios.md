# Design Document: AI-Powered "What If" Scenarios

**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** $(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
**Status:** Conceptual

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the conceptual design for the **AI-Powered "What If" Scenarios** feature of the Privacy Protocol project. This capability aims to utilize AI to suggest plausible worst-case scenarios and alternative interpretations of clauses found in privacy policies, helping users understand the potential far-reaching implications of the terms they are agreeing to.

This feature directly supports the **"S - Sense the Landscape, Secure the Solution"** aspect of the Expanded KISS Principle by proactively highlighting potential negative outcomes.

## 2. Goals

*   To make abstract legal clauses more tangible by illustrating potential negative consequences.
*   To help users understand how ambiguous or broadly worded clauses could be interpreted to their disadvantage.
*   To encourage critical thinking about the data permissions being granted.
*   To provide these scenarios in a clear, concise, and understandable manner, avoiding excessive fear-mongering but ensuring impact.

## 3. Core Functionality

### 3.1. Input

*   Specific clauses identified by the `PrivacyInterpreter` as ambiguous, overly broad, or potentially risky.
*   The context of the clause within the policy.
*   (Optional) The type of service the policy pertains to (e.g., social media, e-commerce, health app), as this can influence plausible scenarios.
*   (Optional) User profile data, if certain scenarios are more relevant to specific user concerns.

### 3.2. Scenario Generation Process (Conceptual)

1.  **Clause Analysis:**
    *   The AI component will receive a specific clause (e.g., "We may share your data with trusted third-party partners for business purposes, including but not limited to marketing and analytics.").
    *   It needs to understand the key entities, actions, and level of specificity in the clause.

2.  **Scenario Brainstorming (AI-driven):**
    *   **Pattern-based Generation:** For common risky clause types, predefined scenario templates could be used and filled in.
        *   *Example Clause:* "We retain your data for as long as necessary to fulfill our business purposes."
        *   *Scenario Template:* "What if 'as long as necessary' means they keep your data indefinitely, even after you stop using the service, for potential future unspecified uses?"
    *   **LLM-based Generation (Future - requires careful implementation):**
        *   Prompt a Large Language Model (LLM) with the clause and ask it to generate potential negative interpretations or outcomes.
        *   *Prompt Example:* "Given the privacy policy clause: '[Clause Text]', what are some plausible worst-case scenarios for a user if a company interprets this broadly or acts in a self-serving way?"
        *   This requires strong prompt engineering and potentially fine-tuning to ensure relevance and avoid generating overly outlandish or irrelevant scenarios.
    *   **Knowledge Base Augmentation:** The AI could draw upon a knowledge base of common privacy pitfalls, data breach examples, or known controversial practices by companies.

3.  **Plausibility Filtering & Refinement:**
    *   Generated scenarios must be plausible. Wildly speculative or unrealistic scenarios will reduce user trust.
    *   Filter out scenarios that are too generic or not directly related to the clause.
    *   Refine the language to be clear, concise, and impactful. Use "AI Humanization" principles: make it relatable.

4.  **Presentation:**
    *   Present scenarios clearly linked to the original clause.
    *   Use cautious but clear language (e.g., "This could mean...", "One possible interpretation is...", "Imagine if...").

### 3.3. Output

*   For a given clause, a small number (1-3) of concise "What If" scenarios.
*   Each scenario should clearly state the potential negative outcome or interpretation.

**Example:**

*   **Clause:** "We may collect usage data, including pages visited, features used, and time spent on our platform, to improve our services."
*   **"What If" Scenario 1:** "What if this 'usage data' is combined with your personal information and sold to data brokers who build a detailed profile about your habits and preferences without your direct knowledge?"
*   **"What If" Scenario 2:** "Consider if 'to improve our services' is later interpreted to mean training AI models that could be used for purposes you didn't originally anticipate, and your data becomes part of that training set permanently."

## 4. Technical Considerations

*   **Initial Implementation:** Could start with a curated set of common risky clauses and manually crafted "What If" scenarios.
*   **Rule-Based System:** Develop a system where rules map clause patterns to potential scenarios.
*   **NLP for Clause Understanding:** Use NLP techniques to extract key information from clauses to feed into scenario generators.
*   **LLM Integration (Advanced):**
    *   Requires careful selection of models (considering privacy, cost, and capability).
    *   Extensive prompt engineering and testing.
    *   Mechanisms to review and curate LLM-generated scenarios, at least initially.
    *   Guardrails to prevent harmful, biased, or nonsensical outputs.

## 5. Ethical Considerations

*   **Avoiding FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt):** The goal is to inform, not to scare users unnecessarily. Scenarios must be plausible and presented responsibly.
*   **Accuracy and Fairness:** Scenarios should represent reasonable interpretations, not misrepresent the company's likely intent without basis.
*   **Bias in AI:** If using LLMs, be aware of and mitigate potential biases in the training data that could lead to unfair or skewed scenarios.
*   **User Anxiety:** Provide context and actionable advice alongside scenarios, so users feel empowered rather than helpless.

## 6. Integration with Other Modules

*   **`PrivacyInterpreter`:** This module will be the primary source of clauses that trigger the "What If" scenario generation.
*   **`UserInterface` (Conceptual):** Scenarios need to be presented effectively to the user, perhaps as expandable sections or tooltips next to relevant clauses.
*   **`Recommender`:** Actionable recommendations might be influenced by the severity or nature of the "What If" scenarios generated.

## 7. Future Enhancements

*   **User Feedback Loop:** Allow users to rate the relevance or plausibility of scenarios, helping to refine the generation process.
*   **Contextual Scenarios:** Tailor scenarios more precisely based on the specific industry of the service (e.g., scenarios for a health app vs. a game).
*   **Severity Rating for Scenarios:** Assign a potential impact level to different scenarios.

This feature has the potential to be highly impactful but requires careful and ethical implementation, especially if leveraging advanced AI like LLMs. An iterative approach, starting simple and gradually adding sophistication, is recommended.
