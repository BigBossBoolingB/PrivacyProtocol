# Personalized Privacy Profiles Design Document

## 1. Purpose & Rationale

Personalized Privacy Profiles are a core component of the Privacy Protocol, designed to **empower users with granular, intuitive control over their data privacy**. Instead of one-size-fits-all settings, profiles allow users to define their preferences based on context, purpose, and data type. This is crucial for:
* **User Sovereignty:** Giving users true control over their digital footprint.
* **Intuitive Consent:** Simplifying complex consent decisions by allowing users to express preferences once, which are then applied dynamically.
* **Dynamic Enforcement:** Enabling the system to automatically apply privacy rules based on individual profiles.
* **Strategic Alignment:** Directly supporting "Granular Privacy Controls & AI-Assisted Consent" in DashAIBrowser and the broader vision of user-centric digital ecosystems.

## 2. Core Functionality ("What")

Personalized Privacy Profiles will encompass the following key functions:

* **Profile Creation & Management:** Users create and manage multiple privacy profiles (e.g., "Strict Privacy," "Balanced," "Marketing Opt-in").
* **Granular Preference Definition:** For each profile, users define preferences for:
    * **Data Categories:** Which types of data (e.g., `Personal_Info`, `Usage_Data`) can be used.
    * **Purposes:** For which purposes (e.g., `Analytics`, `Marketing`).
    * **Third Parties:** With whom data can be shared.
    * **Obfuscation Preferences:** Preferred methods (Redact, Hash, Tokenize, Encrypt) for different data attributes if consent is partial.
* **Active Profile Selection:** Users select which profile is currently active.
* **Consent Record Generation:** When a profile is applied to a specific policy, it generates a `UserConsent` record.
* **AI-Assisted Profile Creation/Refinement:** AI (leveraging **EchoSphere AI-vCPU's Language_Modeler** and **Control_Core**) can suggest profile settings based on user behavior patterns or common privacy archetypes.
* **Verifiable Consent (Conceptual):** Cryptographic signing of `UserConsent` records to ensure immutability and auditability (linking to **DigiSocialBlock's Blockchain** and **EmPower1 Blockchain**).

## 3. High-Level Implementation Strategy ("How")

Personalized Privacy Profiles will be implemented in Python.

* **Data Structures:** Utilize the `UserConsent` and `DataAttribute` classes. Define a new `PrivacyProfile` class to store user-defined preferences.
* **Storage:** Store `PrivacyProfile` and `UserConsent` objects persistently (e.g., JSON files initially, with future integration with **DigiSocialBlock's DDS** for decentralized storage).
* **API:** Expose a clear API for profile creation, selection, and consent generation.
* **Integration with UI:** Designed to integrate with a user-friendly frontend interface (e.g., DashAIBrowser's privacy dashboard).
* **AI Integration:** AI-driven suggestions for profile settings will be a key feature, learning from user behavior.

## 4. Synergies & Interconnections

* **`UserConsent` Data Structure:** Directly generates and manages instances of this class.
* **`PrivacyPolicy`:** Profiles define preferences that are applied against specific policies.
* **`ConsentManager`:** Uses the `ConsentManager` to store and retrieve `UserConsent` records generated by profiles.
* **`PolicyEvaluator`:** Provides the `UserConsent` objects that the Evaluator uses for data access decisions.
* **DashAIBrowser:** The primary interface for users to manage and activate their profiles.
* **EchoSphere AI-vCPU:** The `Control_Core` for profile management logic, `Memory_Core` for storing profile data, and `Language_Modeler` for AI-assisted profile suggestions.
* **DigiSocialBlock:** For decentralized storage of profiles and verifiable consent records.

## 5. Anticipated Challenges & Conceptual Solutions

* **Complexity for Users:** Granular controls can be overwhelming for average users.
    * **Solution:** Provide pre-defined profile templates (e.g., "Default," "Strict," "Marketing Opt-out"). Use AI-assisted suggestions to simplify choices.
* **Dynamic Policy Changes:** How to handle existing profiles when a `PrivacyPolicy` changes.
    * **Solution:** Notify users of policy changes. AI can highlight relevant changes and suggest profile adjustments. Require re-consent for significant changes.
* **Scalability of Profile Storage:** Managing potentially millions of profiles.
    * **Solution:** Decentralized storage solutions (`DigiSocialBlock DDS`). Optimized indexing.
