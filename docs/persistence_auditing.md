# Persistence and Auditing

The Privacy Protocol provides robust mechanisms for persisting privacy policies and user consent, as well as for auditing all data transformations.

## Persistence

The `PolicyStore` and `ConsentStore` provide secure and persistent storage for privacy policies and user consent records. They use JSON file persistence by default, but they can be easily extended to support other storage backends.

## Auditing

The `DataTransformationAuditor` provides a tamper-evident logging system that records all data transformations. It creates a new log entry for each data processing event, and it includes a cryptographic hash of the original data, the transformed data, the policy ID, the consent ID, and the outcome. The log entries are chained together using the hash of the previous log entry, which makes it possible to detect any tampering with the log.

## Verification

The `PrivacyPolicyVerifier` is a conceptual module for formally verifying the properties of a privacy policy. It uses techniques from formal methods to ensure that policies are sound and complete. This module is still under development, but it will eventually provide a powerful tool for ensuring the correctness and security of privacy policies.
