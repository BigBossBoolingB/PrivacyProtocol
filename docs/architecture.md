# Privacy Protocol Architecture

The Privacy Protocol is designed as a modular and extensible framework for privacy-by-design. It consists of several core components that work together to provide a comprehensive solution for privacy enforcement.

## Core Components

*   **Data Structures:** The foundation of the protocol is a set of well-defined data structures, including `PrivacyPolicy`, `UserConsent`, and `DataAttribute`. These structures provide a common language for expressing and enforcing privacy rules.
*   **Storage:** The `PolicyStore` and `ConsentStore` provide secure and persistent storage for privacy policies and user consent records.
*   **Enforcement Engine:** The `PrivacyEnforcer` is the central orchestrator of the protocol. It uses the `DataClassifier`, `PolicyEvaluator`, and `ObfuscationEngine` to process data according to user consent and the governing privacy policy.
*   **Auditing:** The `DataTransformationAuditor` provides a tamper-evident logging system that records all data transformations, providing a verifiable audit trail for privacy compliance.
*   **Verification:** The `PrivacyPolicyVerifier` is a conceptual module for formally verifying the properties of a privacy policy, using techniques from formal methods to ensure that policies are sound and complete.

## Data Flow

The following diagram illustrates the data flow through the Privacy Protocol:
