## For Developers: Technical Overview

Privacy Protocol is a modern React application that provides a sophisticated frontend for privacy policy analysis. The application follows a clean architecture pattern where the React frontend handles user experience while delegating all complex analysis to the Base44 API backend.

### 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
[User Browser] → [React SPA] → [Base44 API] → [AI Analysis Engine]
```

- **React Frontend**: Handles UI/UX, state management, and user interactions
- **Base44 API**: Processes privacy policies, calculates risk scores, manages subscriptions
- **AI Backend**: Performs natural language processing and policy analysis

### 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with Vite for fast development and building
- **UI Library**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context API with custom hooks for API integration
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod schema validation
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts for analytics and trend visualization
- **API Integration**: Custom Base44 API client with caching and error handling

### 🚀 Quick Start for Developers

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/BigBossBoolingB/PrivacyProtocol.git
cd PrivacyProtocol
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```
