# System Policies

## System Architecture Policies

1. **System Design**
   - All system designs must follow a documented architecture pattern
   - System architecture must be reviewed and approved before implementation
   - Architecture diagrams must be maintained and updated with each major release
   - System boundaries and interfaces must be clearly defined

2. **Scalability**
   - Systems must be designed to scale horizontally when possible
   - Performance benchmarks must be established during design phase
   - Load testing must be performed before production deployment
   - Auto-scaling policies must be defined for cloud-based systems

3. **Availability**
   - Critical systems must have a minimum of 99.9% uptime SLA
   - Redundancy must be built into all mission-critical components
   - Failover mechanisms must be tested quarterly
   - Disaster recovery plans must be documented and tested annually

4. **Interoperability**
   - All systems must use standard protocols for communication
   - APIs must be versioned and backward compatible
   - Data exchange formats must be standardized across the organization
   - Integration points must be documented in the system architecture

5. **Monitoring**
   - All systems must implement health checks and monitoring
   - Alerts must be configured for critical system metrics
   - Monitoring dashboards must be available to operations teams
   - System telemetry must be collected and stored for at least 90 days

6. **Documentation**
   - System architecture must be documented and accessible to all stakeholders
   - Configuration parameters must be documented with default and acceptable values
   - System dependencies must be documented and versioned
   - Technical debt must be documented and prioritized for resolution
