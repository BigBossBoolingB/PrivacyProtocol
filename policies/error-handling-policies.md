# Error Handling Policies

## Error Management Policies

1. **Error Detection**
   - All possible error conditions must be identified during design
   - Error detection must be implemented at all system boundaries
   - Timeout mechanisms must be implemented for all external calls
   - Health checks must detect and report error conditions

2. **Error Logging**
   - All errors must be logged with appropriate context
   - Error logs must include timestamp, severity, and correlation IDs
   - Personally identifiable information must not be included in error logs
   - Log levels must be used appropriately (debug, info, warn, error, fatal)

3. **Error Reporting**
   - Critical errors must trigger alerts to responsible teams
   - Error reporting must include sufficient context for troubleshooting
   - Error aggregation must be implemented to prevent alert fatigue
   - Error trends must be analyzed and reported

4. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - Each application must have a documented error handling strategy
   - Error handling must be consistent throughout the application
   - Global error handlers must be implemented
   - Error recovery procedures must be documented

5. **User-Facing Errors**
   - User-facing error messages must be clear and actionable
   - Technical details must not be exposed to end users
   - Error codes must be used for tracking and documentation
   - Localization must be applied to error messages

6. **Error Recovery**
   - Retry policies must be defined for transient errors
   - Circuit breakers must be implemented for external dependencies
   - Fallback mechanisms must be defined for critical functions
   - Recovery point objectives must be defined for data integrity

7. **Exception Management**
   - Exception hierarchies must be defined and documented
   - Custom exceptions must be used for business logic errors
   - Exceptions must be handled at the appropriate level
   - Exception handling must not swallow errors without logging
