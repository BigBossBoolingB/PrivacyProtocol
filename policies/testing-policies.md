# Testing Policies

## Testing Approach Policies

1. **Test Planning**
   - Test plans must be created for all development initiatives
   - Test coverage targets must be defined before development
   - Risk-based testing approach must be documented
   - Test environments must be defined in the test plan

2. **Unit Testing**
   - All code must have unit tests with minimum 80% coverage
   - Unit tests must be automated and run in CI/CD pipelines
   - Test-driven development is recommended for core functionality
   - Unit tests must be maintained alongside code changes

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Integration points must be tested with realistic data
   - Service contracts must be verified through integration tests
   - Integration test environments must mirror production configurations
   - Mock services should be used for external dependencies

4. **System Testing**
   - End-to-end test scenarios must cover critical user journeys
   - System tests must verify non-functional requirements
   - System test data must be representative of production
   - System tests must be automated where possible

5. **Performance Testing**
   - Performance tests must be conducted for all user-facing systems
   - Load tests must verify system behavior under expected peak load
   - Stress tests must identify breaking points
   - Performance benchmarks must be established and monitored

6. **Security Testing**
   - SAST (Static Application Security Testing) must be integrated in CI/CD
   - DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) must be performed pre-release
   - Penetration testing must be conducted annually
   - Security test results must be reviewed by security specialists

7. **Acceptance Testing**
   - User acceptance criteria must be defined before development
   - UAT must be conducted with stakeholder participation
   - Acceptance test results must be documented
   - Sign-off must be obtained before production release

8. **Test Automation**
   - Test automation strategy must be defined for each project
   - Automated tests must be maintainable and reliable
   - Test automation code must follow the same quality standards as application code
   - Test automation results must be visible to all team members

9. **Test Data Management**
   - Test data must be anonymized when derived from production
   - Test data generation must be automated where possible
   - Test data must cover edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Test data must be version-controlled
