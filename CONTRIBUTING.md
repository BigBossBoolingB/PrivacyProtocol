# Contributing to Privacy Protocol

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Privacy Protocol! Your help is essential for creating a tool that empowers users to understand and manage their digital privacy.

This project is in its early stages, and we welcome contributions of all kinds, from code and documentation to ideas and feedback.

## How to Contribute

We are currently focused on laying the foundational codebase. Here are some ways you can contribute:

*   **Reporting Bugs:** If you find a bug, please open an issue on our GitHub repository. Include as much detail as possible: steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
*   **Suggesting Enhancements:** Have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one? Open an issue to discuss it.
*   **Code Contributions:**
    *   If you'd like to work on an existing issue, please comment on it to let others know.
    *   For new features, it's best to discuss your idea in an issue first to ensure it aligns with the project's goals.
    *   Fork the repository, create a new branch for your feature or bugfix, and submit a pull request.
*   **Documentation:** Clear and comprehensive documentation is crucial. If you see areas that can be improved or new documentation that's needed, feel free to contribute.
*   **Feedback:** Your feedback on the project's direction, design, and features is highly valuable.

## Development Setup (Conceptual)

1.  **Fork & Clone:** Fork the repository and clone it locally.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/PrivacyProtocol.git
    cd PrivacyProtocol
    ```
2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # Install development dependencies if we create a requirements-dev.txt
    # pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```
4.  **Running Tests:**
    (We will be using `unittest` initially. Ensure your contributions pass all tests.)
    ```bash
    python -m unittest discover -s tests
    # Or if using pytest:
    # pytest
    ```

## Coding Guidelines (To Be Expanded)

*   Follow PEP 8 for Python code.
*   Write clear, readable, and maintainable code.
*   Include docstrings for modules, classes, and functions.
*   Write tests for your code. Aim for good test coverage.
*   Keep pull requests focused on a single issue or feature.
*   Ensure your commit messages are clear and descriptive.

## AGENTS.md

If you are an AI agent assisting with development, please refer to the `AGENTS.md` file in the root directory (and any relevant subdirectories) for specific instructions, conventions, or tasks related to your operations.

## Community
